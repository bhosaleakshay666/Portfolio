## Projects

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/bhosaleakshay666/Portfolio/blob/main/images/quora.jpg"> **[NLP - Quora Question Pair Similarity using NBC, LSTM, and BERT](https://github.com/bhosaleakshay666/NLP-Quora-Question-Pairs-Similarity)**

In this project I have used basic and complex Machine Learning Algorithms, both pre-trained and self-trained. Conducted analysis of model performance with respect to computation resource and time elapsed, thereby observing efficiency.

The objective of this project is to analyze the distribution of topics and the sentiments expressed in TripAdvisor reviews. With LDA we get a glimpse of each keywords frequency and the visualization with pyLDAvis provides unique insight into the sentiment around the specific keyword.

In this project we conducted experiments of training and observing the efficiency of a couple of Deep Learning Models to predict American Sign language efficiently. Experiments provided the data of training time over different number of GPU's  with respect to model training epochs, data distribution and parallel types of parallelization used.

This repository contains a serverless architecture for data analysis that is robust and can be scaled to incoroprate a multitude of users by using concurrency in lambda functions. This project uses the AWS architecture, mainly - Amazon S3, Amazon ECR and AWS Lambda functions. Quick access to the frontend web application built using **[Streamlit](https://share.streamlit.io/akshatananjappa/salesforcaststreamlit/app.py)**

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/bhosaleakshay666/Portfolio/blob/main/images/sevir.PNG"> **[SEVIR - Weather NowCasting Pipeline](https://github.com/bhosaleakshay666/SEVIR-NowCasting-Machine-Learning-Pipeline)**

In this project, we have deployed the code for the paper SEVIR: A Storm Event Imagery Dataset for Deep Learning Applications of Nowcasting using images provided via Radar and Satellite Meteorology. Used pretrained model, migrated data to GCP from AWS, designed and implemented the nowcasting pipeline. Nowcasting is a prediction task of generating weather forecasts like radar echoes, precipitation, cloud coverage using meteorological knowledge.
The models here take input of 13 VIL images, each sampled at every 5 minutes, train and generate the next 12 images in the sequence for the following hour

The notebook provides full code to load data, build, train and generate text from the LSTM [Long Shert term Memory] a RNN model. It can be easily adapted to any text corpus. The resulting model can generate new realistic text after training on a large dataset.

#

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/bhosaleakshay666/Portfolio/blob/main/images/20%20news.png"> **[NLP - Classify 20 News Group using Naive Bayes, LSTM, and BERT](https://github.com/bhosaleakshay666/NLP-Spam-Ham-20-News-Group)** 

This Jupyter notebook classifies various news into one of the 20 news groups using basic to complex Machine Learning algorithms. The notebook provides insights into model training, accuracy and time elapsed, thereby providing us with efficiency of each model.

#

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/bhosaleakshay666/Portfolio/blob/main/images/stock.PNG"> **[FinTech - Tesla Stock Financial Analysis and Prediction using Machine Learning](https://github.com/bhosaleakshay666/Fintech-Stock-Analysis-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning)** 

In this project I applied various financial analysis techniques using Python for fundamental decision making. Further I explored trading startegies based on the obersvations made after fitting data to existing moving averages or training a Machine Learning model to fit the historical and predict prices or generate signals.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/bhosaleakshay666/Portfolio/blob/main/images/pexels-adem-albayrak-18187196.jpg"> **[Rain Prediction in Australia using Machine Learning](https://github.com/bhosaleakshay666/Rain-Prediction-in-Australia)** 

We will try to answer the question of whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia. We implemented kNN, Decision tree, Random Forest with Python and Scikit-Learn.
We have used the Rain in Australia dataset for this project.
